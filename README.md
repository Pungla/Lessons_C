# C++ Programming Examples

This repository contains a collection of C++ programming examples organized by various fundamental and advanced topics. Each directory contains source code files demonstrating key concepts related to the topic.

## Topics

### First_proge—Åt
The "First_project" directory includes the initial project examples, which might cover basic syntax, control structures, data types, and other introductory topics in C++ programming.

### Abstract_class
This directory contains examples demonstrating the use of abstract classes in C++. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are designed to be base classes for other derived classes. They typically contain at least one pure virtual function.

### Dynamic_array
This directory showcases the implementation and usage of dynamic arrays in C++. Dynamic arrays can change size during runtime, allowing for more flexible and efficient memory management compared to static arrays.

### Dynamic_memory
Examples in this directory illustrate dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using pointers, `new`, and `delete` operators in C++. Proper management of dynamic memory is crucial to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient resource utilization.

### Indicator_to_the_function
This directory provides examples of function pointers in C++. Function pointers allow functions to be passed as arguments to other functions, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

### Links
Examples here demonstrate the use of references and pointers in C++. Understanding references and pointers is essential for manipulating memory and handling data structures efficiently.

### Memory
This directory contains examples related to memory management in C++, including stack vs. heap memory, memory allocation, deallocation, and common pitfalls such as memory leaks and dangling pointers.

### Overloading_functions
Examples in this directory show how to overload functions and operators in C++. Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters to coexist, while operator overloading enables custom behavior for operators when applied to user-defined types.

### Recursion
This directory provides examples of recursive functions in C++. Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

### Single_list
Examples in this directory illustrate the implementation of singly linked lists. Singly linked lists are a basic data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

### Template_functions
This directory showcases examples of template functions and classes in C++. Templates enable writing generic and reusable code that can operate with any data type.

### Two-dimensional_dynamic_array
Examples in this directory demonstrate the creation and manipulation of two-dimensional dynamic arrays in C++. These arrays are useful for representing matrices and other grid-like data structures.

### Virtual_methods
This directory contains examples of virtual methods and polymorphism in C++. Virtual methods allow derived classes to override methods defined in base classes, enabling dynamic method dispatch and runtime polymorphism.
